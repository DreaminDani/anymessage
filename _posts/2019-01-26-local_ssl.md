Steps mostly borrowed from: https://medium.com/@oliver.zampieri/self-signed-ssl-reverse-proxy-with-docker-dbfc78c05b41

From the root directory of anymessage:
```
mkdir nginx
cd nginx
```

Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and create a new cert for anymessage (or whatever domain you're using)
```
mkcert -install # you can skip this step, if you've already done it
mkcert anymessage.io "*.anymessage.io" localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

make a file "proxy_ssl.conf", using your local IP in the proxy_pass lines
```
server {
    listen 80;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/conf.d/cert.pem; # this is the name of your mkcert cert file
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/conf.d/key.pem; # this is the name of your mkcert key file
    server_name api.anymessage.io # your api domain
    proxy_pass_header Server;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

        proxy_pass http://api:1337/; # your API_PORT
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl default_server;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/conf.d/cert.pem; # this is the name of your mkcert cert file
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/conf.d/key.pem; # this is the name of your mkcert key file
    proxy_pass_header Server;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

        proxy_pass http://ui:3000/;
    }
}
```

run the ssl version of docker-compose:
```
cd .. # get back into the root directory of this project
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ssl.yml up
```

In order to access the proxied webservice via the url you used in your .env file, you'll have to update your hosts file to look something like:
```
127.0.0.1 www.anymessage.io anymessage.io test.anymessage.io example.anymessage.io api.anymessage.io
```
where `www` and `api` are the only required ones, the naked domain is for convenience/testing while the other domains are what you'll use as teamURLs. This is because `/etc/hosts` doesn't support wild card entries.

When you first access the app, you'll get a warning from your browser about the self-signed cert. You can ignore it by clicking the "advanced options" somewhere. *In order for API requests to work, you'll have to navigate to your api domain and allow its cert as well*. If you don't do this, API requests (like logging in) will silently fail due to a CORS issue. See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29342094
- Every time you change a teamURL, your browser will ask again to trust the self-signed cert.
