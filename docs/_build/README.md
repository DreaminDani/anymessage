# How to use Docs

Docs are built with Jekyll and deployed to netlify automatically. A GitHub action uses the /docs Dockerfile to build the API documentation from swagger and typedoc. All other docs are generated via Jekyll.

## Contributing

To contribute to the docs, simply add a post to /docs/_posts. The following categories are supported:
- help
- deployment
