But it's not who you are underneath... it's what you do that defines you. Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid.

Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.

It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.

I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.

Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of the plane.

My name is Merely Ducard but I speak for Ra's al Ghul... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A mon who can offer you a path. Someone like you is only here by choice. You have been exploring the criminal fraternity but whatever your original intentions you have to become truly lost. The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows.

Okay. Now... Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped, tri-weave fibers for flexibility. You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

If you're good at something, never do it for free.

It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.

Your Punishment Must Be More Severe.
